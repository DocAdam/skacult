                <h3>Dress sharply but think sharper: Challenge stereotypes and prejudice.</h3>
                <h3>Move to the rhythm, but also move against injustice.</h3>
                <h3>Keep the faith in the face of adversity.</h3>
                <h3>Speak out for those without a voice.</h3>
                <h3>Skank with pride, stand with dignity.</h3>
                <h3>Remember the roots, but water the future.</h3>
                <h3>Build bridges, not walls, with the beats.</h3>
                <h3>Respect all, but bow to none unjustly.</h3>
                <h3>Carry the message of Ska — unity and joy — everywhere.</h3>
                <h3>Never forget: The battle against inequality is fought on the dancefloor and beyond.</h3>
