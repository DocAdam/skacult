                <p>This Statement of Fundamental Ska Truths is intended as a basis of fellowship among us, ensuring unity and shared understanding within the Ska Cult (i.e., that we all appreciate and live by the same musical and cultural ethos). The terminology employed here is not meant to be absolute or dogmatic, but the truths set forth are considered essential to our collective identity and full appreciation of Ska music and culture. This document does not encompass all truths about Ska but covers our need as to these fundamental elements.</p>
